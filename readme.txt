Public Scripts

A group of script modules for Dark Engine based games. These modules collect
a number of well-known scripts into a single place. So fan-mission designers
have greater freedom to create novel and entertaining experiences.

The script documentation for fan-mission authors is hosted online at The
Dromesday Book. Please go to https://dromed.whoopdedo.org/public_scripts/index
to learn how you can use custom scripts in your missions.
